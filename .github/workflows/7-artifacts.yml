## summary:
## actions/upload-artifact
# -----------------------------
#You‚Äôre actually calling another mini-program (Action) that lives inside a GitHub repository.
# For example:
# üëâ The real repository for this one is here:
# üîó https://github.com/actions/upload-artifact

#That repo contains:
#A small Node.js program (JavaScript)
#A configuration file (action.yml)
#Logic to handle uploading and downloading

#So your workflow step basically says:
#‚ÄúRun the JavaScript code defined in that GitHub repository, version v2.‚Äù
